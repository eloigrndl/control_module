Eloi Garandel, Bachelor Semester Project Git repository, EPFL 2020-2021

The project consists of implementating a control algorithm. I first implement it for a Loomo robot (2-wheel robot)
and then this algorithm should be adapted to be use as the control alogorithm of the Driverless car of the EPFL Racing Team.

Source files are separated in two folders, one implementing each model. They are quite similar as the overall structure of each is the same but the motion equations change for each model.

I also provided a visualization tool that simulates each of the model on the given model.
To launch it, run visualization.py (using Python 3.9)
Small real tests footage is also available.

Note 17/12/2020 :
- visualization tool isn't done yet, plan to display more information to screen
- car model still needs small adjustement (but the real value that will be used on the RT car will be calculated using IRL tests)

Note 19/12/2020 :
- visualization tool updated
- car model updated
- might add more path to test larger beahviors

Note 4/1/2021 :
- visualization tool updated
- first draft report added

Note 5/1/2021 :
- final report
